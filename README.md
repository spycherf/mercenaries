# Mercenaries (card game)

_Mercenaries_, also known as _Mercs_, or _GOT'M_ (which stands for _Gnolls, Ogres, Trolls 'n Murlocs_), is a two-player, turn-based card game inspired by the _Warcraft_ franchise. It requires a standard 52-card deck of French-suited playing cards. A game typically lasts 15 to 20 minutes.

## Setting

The game is set in the world of Azeroth. The Horde and the Alliance are waging war in the luxuriant jungle of Stranglethorn Vale, on the outskirts of the neutral seaport of Booty Bay. To bolster their ranks, the two factions hire local mercenaries from various races: Gnolls, Ogres, Trolls and Murlocs. These fierce soldiers of fortune engage in merciless combat, often against their own kind...

## Rules

The game rules are found in the `mercenaries_game_rules.md` file.
