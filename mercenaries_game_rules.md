# Mercenaries (card game)

_Mercenaries_, also known as _Mercs_, or _GOT'M_ (which stands for _Gnolls, Ogres, Trolls 'n Murlocs_), is a two-player, turn-based card game inspired by the _Warcraft_ franchise. It requires a standard 52-card deck of French-suited playing cards. A game typically lasts 15 to 20 minutes.

## Setting

The game is set in the world of Azeroth. The Horde and the Alliance are waging war in the luxuriant jungle of Stranglethorn Vale, on the outskirts of the neutral seaport of Booty Bay. To bolster their ranks, the two factions hire local mercenaries from various races: Gnolls, Ogres, Trolls and Murlocs. These fierce soldiers of fortune engage in merciless combat, often against their own kind...

## Cards

### Suits and ranks

Each suit represents a race:

- Clubs = Gnolls
- Hearts = Ogres
- Diamonds = Trolls
- Spades = Murlocs

Face cards each represent a different type of _mercenary_:

- Jacks = _veterans_. Their attacks deal collateral damage.
- Queens = _spellcasters_. They conjure lightning to strike multiple targets.
- Kings = _leaders_. Their toughness allows them to sustain more damage.

For a more immersive experience, players can refer to veterans, spellcasters and leaders by using the race-specific terms, namely:

- Gnolls: Brute, Mystic, Alpha
- Ogres: Warrior, Shaman, Warlord
- Trolls: Berserker, Witch Doctor, Shadow Hunter
- Murlocs: Raider, Oracle, Tidecaller

Numbered cards are a player's _resources_. When recruiting new mercenaries, they represent currency; during combat, they become fighting units, which are defined as such:

- 2-6 = _basic units_ (or _shields_). They have the ability to protect other cards.
- 6-9 = _advanced units_ (or _elites_). Two elites can coordinate their attacks on one or multiple targets.
- 10 = _tank_. Tanks force the opponent to attack them instead of other cards.

(Sixes are hybrid cards with the properties of both basic and advanced units.)
 
Aces represent _artifacts_. These powerful items can be equipped by cards matching the racial requirement to boost their allies and themselves.

See § [Playing](#playing) for more information on what cards do and how they can be combined to provide bonuses.

### Values and attack power

For mercenary and resource cards, a card's _value_ is both its base _attack power_ (AP) and the minimum AP required to defeat it with a single attack.

The value of mercenaries and artifacts is also the cost of hiring/purchasing them.

A card's value depends on its rank:

- Veterans = 11
- Spellcasters = 12
- Leaders = 13
- Resource cards = the card's number
- Artifacts = 10

## Dealing

The dealer is chosen by any agreed-upon method. If multiple games are played, dealership alternates from game to game.

Mercenaries, resources and artifacts are sorted into distinct piles, which are then shuffled.

The dealer deals one mercenary face down to each player, starting with their opponent. The remaining mercenaries are placed face down on one side of the _battlefield_ (i.e., the area directly in front of the players). This pile is the _mercenary camp_ (or _camp_ for short).

The artifact pile is placed next to the mercenary pile. This is the _Goblin merchant_ (or simply _merchant_). The merchant and the camp are collectively referred to as the _shop_.

Finally, the dealer deals ten resource cards one by one to each player, starting with their opponent. They place the remaining resource cards face down next to the merchant. This pile is the _Goblin bank_ (or just _bank_).

Players always keep their hand hidden from one another.

## Playing

A game is played over multiple rounds. Each round comprises three phases: _recruitment_ (or _shopping_), _combat_ (or _skirmish_) and _recovery_.

### Recruitment

During this phase, players can hire new mercenaries and acquire artifacts. If they have no mercenary left, they are obligated to recruit one. If they do not have enough currency to do so, the game ends (see § [End of the game](#end)).

In the first round, the non-dealer gets to shop first. In subsequent rounds, the loser of the previous round always shops first.

The dealer draws the top three cards from the mercenary camp and lays them in a row face up next to the pile (the top card should be the closest to the pile and the third card furthest away). Then, they draw the top card from the Goblin merchant and place it face up next to the pile.

Players take turns shopping. They can skip their turn or do one of four actions:

- **Hire a mercenary**. To hire a mercenary, players must spend resources of the currency matching that mercenary's race. For the transaction to be valid, the summed values of the resource cards must be greater or equal to the value of the mercenary. Any amount over the mercenary's value is lost. Discarded resources are shown clearly to the opponent (to avoid any foul play) then placed face up next to the Goblin bank.

- **Swap mercenaries**. Players can exchange a mercenary from their hand for a mercenary from the camp. Any mercenary can be hired this way as long as its value is lower or equal to that of the discarded mercenary.

- **Purchase the artifact**. The same rules as the ones for hiring mercenaries apply.

- **Swap artifacts**. Instead of purchasing the artifact, players can trade one of their own artifacts for it.

If players have an artifact in their hand, they can sell it to the merchant by placing the artifact face down at the bottom of the pile. In return, they are credited the artifact's value in race-agnostic currency, which must be spent right away (along with resource cards) to hire a mercenary.

The recruitment phase ends when both players have announced that they are done shopping. The dealer closes the shop by placing the revealed cards face down at the bottom of their respective piles (mercenaries are returned in order of proximity).

### Combat

To initiate combat, each player selects a _squad_ of three cards from their hand and places them on the battlefield face down, in a row, so that both squads face each other. A squad must have at least one mercenary. If a player is unable to send any mercenary to the battlefield, the game ends (see § [End of the game](#end)). Once their cards are on the battlefield, players are not allowed to change their position or swap them with cards from their hand.

Players then reveal their cards and can equip them with artifacts. This is done by placing the artifact under and across a card that matches the racial requirement. Should its wearer die, an artifact can be picked up during combat by any adjacent ally of the same race. See § [Combos and bonuses](#bonuses) for information on the artifact's power.

In the first round, the dealer gets to attack first. In subsequent rounds, the loser of the previous round always attacks first.

During combat, players take turns attacking each other. A turn consists of the following steps:

1. **Target selection and taunting**. The attacker selects one card from their squad and one target in the defender's squad. Once announced, this choice is final. 
If the defender has a tank, it _taunts_ the attacker. This forces the attacker to target the tank first until it dies. When there are multiple tanks, the attacker can choose which one to target first.
Some special attacks hit multiple targets (see § [Combos and bonuses](#bonuses) and [Mercenary abilities](#abilities)).

2. **Main attack**. Once the target has been selected, the card executes its _main attack_. It is then pulled away from the skirmish slightly (about half its length). While in that position, the card can still be targeted, but cannot launch another main attack until all cards on the battlefield have attacked or have been defeated. Once that happens, remaining cards are pushed back into the skirmish and can attack once more.
The attacker must skip their turn if they have no cards available for attacking but the defender does.

3. **Shielding**. To protect the target, the defender is allowed to sacrifice one basic unit adjacent to it. This action, referred to as _shielding_, is done by moving the shield card over and across the target.
When the target is shielded, the main attack hits the sacrificed unit instead. After it dies, further damage occurring during the same turn affects the original target.

4. **Damage**. The outcome of the attack is determined by an _AP check_:

    - First, all applicable bonuses (see § [Combos and bonuses](#bonuses)) are added to the attacking card's base AP.
    - If the total AP is greater or equal to the target's value, the target dies.
    - Otherwise, the difference between total AP and value is calculated:
        - 1-7: the target is _wounded_. When wounded, the card is rotated 90°. If the target was already wounded in a previous attack, it dies.
        - 8 or higher: the target is unharmed.

Cards are flipped upon death. Combat ends when a player has lost their entire squad.

### Recovery

The winner of the round cleans the battlefield:

- They bury their dead by stacking the cards face down into a pile on the other side of the battlefield (opposite the shop). This is the _graveyard_, which is common to both players.

- They also cut off their enemies' ears, collecting the cards face down into a pile that they keep close to themselves. This is that player's _string of ears_.

- They loot any artifact dropped by their opponent.

- Finally, they pick up their surviving cards. Healthy cards go back directly to the player's hand. Wounded cards are laid down in front of the player, face up, so that each card remains visible. This is that player's _infirmary_. While in the infirmary, a wounded mercenary cannot be traded for a healthy mercenary during the next recruitment phase. If played during combat, a card from the infirmary will be wounded at the start of the skirmish.

Wounded cards from the previous round are healed and put back into each player's hand.

One by one, starting with the loser, the dealer deals to each player one card from the bank for each card that player has lost (with the exception of artifacts). When the bank's reserves are exhausted, resources spent during the recruitment phase are shuffled then placed face down to form a new pile.

### Combos and bonuses

- **Ancestral Guidance** (or _artifact bonus_). Provided the racial requirement is met, an artifact increases the value of its wearer by 2. The artifact also emits an aura which increases the value of adjacent cards by 1, no matter their race. This bonus does not grant cards new properties (i.e., a veteran wearing an artifact cannot become a leader, a nine under the effect of the artifact's aura cannot act as a tank, etc.).

- **Coordinated Assault**. Two advanced units of the same race can attack two targets simultaneously or focus their attack on a single target. This counts as both cards' main attack. If one of the targets is a tank that neither card can kill by itself with a single attack, both cards must target the tank.

- **Flanking Strike**. After an advanced unit attacks, any card of the same rank attacks as well. This does not count as that card's main attack.

- **Inspiring Presence/Enrage** (or _racial bonus_). If two cards in the squad share the same race, both get +1 AP. If the entire squad is of the same race, all cards get +2 AP instead. The bonus increases by 1 each time a member of that race dies.

### Mercenary abilities

- **Cleaving Attack** (veterans). As part of their main attack, veterans swing their weapon in a wide arc, hitting an adjacent card of the attacker's choice. If that card is wearing an artifact, it is unharmed; if it has a value of 5 or lower, it is killed; otherwise, it is wounded. This additional damage cannot be negated by shielding.

- **Chain Lightning** (spellcasters). Instead of attacking a single target, spellcasters can hurl a bolt of lightning, hitting the defender's entire squad. This attack does not require an AP check. Cards wearing an artifact are unharmed; cards with a value of 5 or lower are killed; others are wounded. The damage cannot be negated by shielding.

- **Hardened Skin** (leaders). The first time they take a damaging hit in the skirmish, leaders can survive a killing blow, but are still wounded. If the attack would only wound them, they remain unharmed.

## End of the game

The game ends when one or both players are unable to send at least one mercenary to the battlefield. Typically, they will already announce this during the recruitment phase, when it becomes clear that they cannot hire any more mercenaries.

For each card that they own, players are awarded points based on the card's location and value:

- Hand: the card's value in points
- Infirmary: half the card's value in points (rounded down)
- String of ears:
    - Resource cards = 1 point
    - Veterans = 2 points
    - Spellcasters = 3 points
    - Leaders = 4 points

The player with the highest number of points wins the game.
